# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my world!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant in [Prof. Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. My current work is a bioinformatics project focusing on livestock genomics and developing a bioinformatics workflow that select desirable CpG sites for inclusion in a DNA methylation array. My research interest lies in functional genetics and genomics and I am keen of their applications in disease and livestock settings. 

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh recently (June 2022) with a bachelor degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). I learned and gained experiences in biofinformatics by participtating various projects during undergraduate life.In summer 2021, I did a two months placement in [Dr.James Prendergast](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-prendergast), which I examined the Boran genome to determine the potential causal variant that confers tolerance to East Coast Fever. During my final (honours) year, I chose a bioinformatics orientated project in [wallace lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), under the supervision of [Dr.Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr.Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). My honours project was about studying the RNA-protein interaction in yeast, focusing on Khd1, and I have developed an improved version of bioinformatics workflow to analyse the interaction between RNA and protein under the guidance of my supervisors. 

Despite doing dry lab most of the time, I am still a geneticist by heart, hoping to do true wet lab (undergrad lab dooesn't count) in the future. My future plan after current job (ending in 2024) is to continue my study. I am currently indecisive between a Master by Research or a Phd but in either choice, I hope to have wet lab in my project. If anyone reading this have seen or advertising hybrid wet and dry lab project, please let me know. You can me contact through my [email](jchong@ed.ac.uk). 

If you have query in my previous work or discussion on genetics, please feel free to contact me via email too.
