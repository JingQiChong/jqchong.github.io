# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my world!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant in [Prof. Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. My current work is a bioinformatics project focusing on livestock genomics and developing a bioinformatics workflow that selects desirable CpG sites for inclusion in a DNA methylation array. My research interest lies in functional genetics and genomics and I am keen on their applications in disease and livestock settings. 

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh at 2022 with a bachelor's degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). I learned and gained experience in bioinformatics by participating in various projects during my undergraduate life. In the summer of 2021, I did a two months placement under [Dr. James Prendergast](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-prendergast), which I examined the Boran genome to determine the potential causal variant that confers tolerance to East Coast Fever. During my final (honours) year, I chose a bioinformatics-orientated project in [wallace lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), under the supervision of [Dr.Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr.Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). My honours project was about studying the RNA-protein interaction in yeast, focusing on Khd1, and I have developed an improved version of bioinformatics workflow to analyse the interaction between RNA and protein under the guidance of my supervisors. 

My future plan after the current job is to further my study, eventually a PhD. I hope to do a PhD with the bioinformatics and multi-omics elements. I don't have a preference in studying any organism but I would like to try studying human or cancer as I have never done it before. If you are advertising a project, please feel free to let me know. You can me contact through my [email](jchong@ed.ac.uk). 

If you have any queries in my previous work or discussion on genetics, please feel free to contact me via email too.
