# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my world!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant in [Prof Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa) lab at the Roslin Institute. Currently, I am working on a bioinformatics project with [Dr Pau Navarro](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/pau-navarro), focusing on livestock genomics and developing a bioinformatics workflow capable of tailoring a DNA methylation array to the user's needs. 

My research interest lies in multi-omics, and I am keen on applying these approaches to understand the variation of traits between individuals in disease and livestock settings. Moreover, my bioinformatician alter ego enjoys developing tools and reproducible workflows for data analysis.

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 2022 with a bachelor's degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). I learned and gained experience in bioinformatics by participating in various projects during my undergraduate life. In the summer of 2021, I did a two-month placement under [Dr. James Prendergast](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-prendergast), which I examined the Boran genome to determine the potential causal variant that confers tolerance to East Coast Fever. During my final (Honours) year, I chose a bioinformatics-orientated project in [wallace lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), under the supervision of [Dr.Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr.Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). My Honours project was about studying the RNA-protein interaction in yeast, focusing on Khd1, and I have developed an improved version of bioinformatics workflow to analyse the interaction between RNA and protein under the guidance of my supervisors. 

Despite having a bioinformatics-focused background, I am eager to learn wet lab skills for my research interests. My plan after my current job is to further my studies by doing a PhD with bioinformatics and multi-omics elements. I don't have a preference in studying any organism but I would like to try studying human or cancer as I have never tried it before. If you are advertising a project, please feel free to let me know. You can me contact through my [email](jchong@ed.ac.uk). 

If you have any queries in my previous work or discussion on genetics, please feel free to contact me via email too.
