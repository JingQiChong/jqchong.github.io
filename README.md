# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my world!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant in [Prof. Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. My current work is a bioinformatics project focusing on livestock genomics and developing a bioinformatics workflow that selects desirable CpG sites for inclusion in a DNA methylation array. My research interest lies in functional genetics and genomics and I am keen on their applications in disease and livestock settings. 

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh recently (June 2022) with a bachelor's degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). I learned and gained experience in bioinformatics by participating in various projects during undergraduate life. In the summer of 2021, I did a two months placement in [Dr. James Prendergast](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-prendergast), which I examined the Boran genome to determine the potential causal variant that confers tolerance to East Coast Fever. During my final (honours) year, I chose a bioinformatics-orientated project in [wallace lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), under the supervision of [Dr.Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr.Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). My honours project was about studying the RNA-protein interaction in yeast, focusing on Khd1, and I have developed an improved version of bioinformatics workflow to analyse the interaction between RNA and protein under the guidance of my supervisors. 

Despite doing dry lab most of the time, I am still a geneticist by heart, hoping to do real wet lab (undergrad lab doesn't count) in the future. My future plan after my current job (ending in 2024) is to continue my study. I am currently indecisive between a Master by Research or a PhD but in either choice, I hope to have a wet lab in my project. If anyone reading this has seen or advertising a hybrid wet and dry lab project, please let me know. You can me contact through my [email](jchong@ed.ac.uk). 

If you have any queries in my previous work or discussion on genetics, please feel free to contact me via email too.
